# Park Run
Web scraper to pull data about park runs from [parkrun UK](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/).

An approach to getting all the information about park runs using 3 main types of pages:
1. [Runner level](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=501501)
2. [Course level](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/margate/results/latestresults/)
3. [Event level](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/margate/results/weeklyresults/?runSeqNumber=233)

You can get all the runs that a particular runner has been on, and of those courses they have run you can look at both the individual event but also historic runs for the route to try and gain population stats about other runners participating. 

You can look at the latest results to find out how many park runs have been held at that particular course.
